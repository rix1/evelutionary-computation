## Evolutionary Computation - Assignment 1


This README should include:

- Whose EA you compared fitness results with? Be sure to include their name and student number as well as the average, maximum, and minimum fitness scores of their EA.
- The results of statistical tests that compare the fitness results of your EA with a classmate’s EA. You should clearly state if there is a statistically significant difference between the average, maximum and minimum fitness of your EA versus your classmate’s EA.
- A working theory as to why there is (or is not) a statistically significant difference between the fitness results of the two EAs (200 words maximum).
